<p>Virtual Reality is a technology that creates a simulated environment , allowing users to feel like they are in a different place or a world by placing them inside a 3-dimensional experience. Simulation of human senses-all five of them-transforms a computer into a vehicle into new worlds.</p>
<p>The three types of virtual reality experiences provide different levels of computer-generated simulation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Non-Immersive Virtual Reality:</strong>  Non-immersive VR technology features a computer-generated virtual environment where the user simultaneously remains aware and controlled by their physical environment. Video games are an example of non-immersive VR.</li>
<li><strong>Semi-Immersive Virtual Reality:</strong>  This type of VR provides an experience partially based in a virtual environment. Flight simulators for pilot trainees is an example.</li>
<li><strong>Fully Immersive Virtual Reality:</strong>  Right now, there are no completely immersive VR technologies. This type of VR generates the most realistic simulation experience, from sight to sound to sometimes even olfactory sensations. Car racing games are an example of immersive virtual reality that gives the user the sensation of speed and driving skills.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="vr-">VR :</h4>
<p>Virtual Reality can use technology to create a simulated environment (like a Pokemon environment ). This simulated environment can be totally different than the reality of this world and yet you can perceive it as reality. So Virtual Reality is really just that, a <strong>“Virtual Reality”</strong> that you can move around in and experience as if you were really there.<br>
It generally requires a headset or a similar kind of device to immerse the user into the digital world.</p>
<h4 id="ar-">AR :</h4>
<p>Augmented Reality basically involves using technology to create an <strong>“Augmented”</strong> version of reality by superimposing digital information over the real world(like the game Pokemon Go!). This can be done using <strong>AR apps</strong> in smartphones that use the camera to display the real world and superimpose extra information like text and images onto that world. The importance of Augmented Reality cannot be understated.</p>
<h4 id="trends-in-space-and-technology-stack-being-developed-">TRENDS IN SPACE AND TECHNOLOGY STACK BEING DEVELOPED :</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wireless VR :</strong> One of the most prominent trends is the widespread adoption of wireless VR headsets that offer freedom of movement.</li>
<li><strong>Social VR :</strong> The rise of social VR platforms, such as VRChat and AltspaceVR, has enabled users to connect in shared virtual spaces, fostering a sense of presence.</li>
<li><strong>VR in healthcare :</strong> Virtual Reality offers new possibilities for patient care and well-being in pain management, physical therapy, and mental health treatment.</li>
<li><strong>Haptic feedback and eye-tracking.</strong> Eye-tracking lets you navigate more naturally, and makes us feel more present in virtual worlds. Haptic feedback adds realistic touch and texture to virtual objects.</li>
<li><strong>Project Phantom</strong> uses VR and AR to enable a digital ecosystem for scientists to engage and collaborate with their mission counterparts on the ground, providing users with the ability to communicate and exchange information through a variety of means.<br>
Using this approach, the scientific community can be provided a <strong>3D model</strong> of the Moon or Mars that can be explored in a VR environment</li>
